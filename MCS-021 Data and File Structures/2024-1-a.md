1. (a) Write an algorithm to find greatest common division of two positive integers.Calculate both space and time complexity for this algorithm. 

Answer:

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm:

```cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2;
    cout << "Enter two positive integers: ";
    cin >> num1 >> num2;

    cout << "GCD of " << num1 << " and " << num2 << " is " << gcd(num1, num2) << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

### Explanation of the Algorithm
- This uses the iterative version of the Euclidean Algorithm.
- Repeatedly replace a with b and b with a % b until b == 0.
- When b == 0, a holds the GCD.

### Time Complexity
- O(log(min(a, b)))
- In each iteration, the size of the numbers decreases significantly (due to the modulo operation), making the algorithm efficient even for large inputs.

### Space Complexity
- O(1) (Constant space)
- Only a few integer variables are used (a, b, temp).
- No recursion or dynamic memory is involved.

##### input:
```
Enter two positive integers: 48 18
```

##### output:
```
GCD of 48 and 18 is 6
```
