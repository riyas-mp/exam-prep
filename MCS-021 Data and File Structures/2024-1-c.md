# Linked List

- A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements, called nodes, are linked using pointers.
- Unlike arrays, linked lists don’t store elements in contiguous memory;
- each node holds its data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence.
- This allows for efficient insertion and deletion at arbitrary positions, at the cost of extra memory for pointers and slower random access.

### Components of a Linked List

1. Node

- Data: the value or payload (e.g. an integer, object, etc.).
- Next Pointer: a reference to the next node in the list (or nullptr if it’s the last node).

2. Head Pointer

- A separate pointer that always points to the first node of the list.
- If the list is empty, the head pointer is nullptr.

1. (c) Write an algorithm to implement a polynomial function using linked list, where function is given as : 10 f(x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d; a, b, c, d are constants.

Answer:

✅ Algorithm (Step-by-step):
Step 1: Define a Node Structure
Each node in the linked list will represent one term in the polynomial and will contain:

- coefficient (a, b, c, d)
- power (3, 2, 1, 0)
- next (pointer to the next term)

```cpp
struct Node {
    int coefficient;
    int power;
    Node* next;
};
```

Step 2: Create a Function to Add a Node to the Polynomial

```cpp
Node* addTerm(Node* head, int coefficient, int power) {
    Node* newNode = new Node{coefficient, power, nullptr};
    if (!head || power > head->power) {
        newNode->next = head;
        return newNode;
    }

    Node* current = head;
    while (current->next && current->next->power > power)
        current = current->next;

    newNode->next = current->next;
    current->next = newNode;

    return head;
}

```

Step 3: Build the Polynomial
Build the list using the constants a, b, c, d.

```cpp
Node* createPolynomial(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    Node* head = nullptr;
    head = addTerm(head, a, 3);
    head = addTerm(head, b, 2);
    head = addTerm(head, c, 1);
    head = addTerm(head, d, 0);
    return head;
}
```

Step 4: Evaluate the Polynomial for a Given x

```cpp
int evaluatePolynomial(Node* head, int x) {
    int result = 0;
    Node* current = head;
    while (current) {
        result += current->coefficient * pow(x, current->power);
        current = current->next;
    }
    return result;
}
```

Step 5: Main Function to Test

```cpp
int main() {
    int a = 2, b = -4, c = 3, d = 5;
    Node* poly = createPolynomial(a, b, c, d);
    int x = 2;
    cout << "f(" << x << ") = " << evaluatePolynomial(poly, x);
    return 0;
}
```

🔍 Time Complexity:
- Creating polynomial: O(n), where n is number of terms (4 here).
- Evaluating: O(n) – traverses each term once.
