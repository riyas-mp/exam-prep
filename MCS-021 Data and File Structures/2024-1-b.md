1. (b) What is Depth First Search (DFS)? Explain the strategy adopted in DFS with an example.

Answer:

### Depth‑First Search (DFS):

DFS is a graph/tree traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a source node, visits an unvisited neighbor, then recursively continues from that neighbor until no unvisited neighbors remain, then backtracks.

The strategy adopted in DFS is to visit a node and then explore all of its neighbors before moving on to the next node. This is done by maintaining a stack of nodes to be explored.

Strategy Adopted in DFS (3 marks):

1. Explore Deeply: From the current node, pick any unvisited adjacent node and “go deeper.”
2. Mark Visited: When you first arrive at a node, mark it visited to avoid cycles.
3. Recursion (or Stack): Use recursion (implicit call‑stack) or an explicit stack to remember the path.
4. Backtrack: When you reach a node with no unvisited neighbors, pop back (return) to the previous node and continue exploring any remaining neighbors.

undirected graph:

```mathematica
    A
   / \
  B   C
  |   |
  D---E
```

Adjacency lists:

```mathematica
A: B, C  
B: A, D  
C: A, E  
D: B, E  
E: C, D  
```

Starting DFS at A, one possible visitation order is:

```mathematica
A → B → D → E → C  
```

Step‑by‑step:

1. Visit A, mark A.
2. From A pick B, visit B, mark B.
3. From B pick D, visit D, mark D.
4. From D pick E, visit E, mark E.
5. From E pick C, visit C, mark C.
6. All neighbors of C are visited, backtrack until stack empty.

```cpp
// (Assume necessary #include <iostream>, <vector> and using namespace std; are present)

void DFS(int u, vector<bool>& visited, vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
    visited[u] = true;
    cout << u << " ";               // process node u
    for (int v : adj[u]) {
        if (!visited[v]) {
            DFS(v, visited, adj);   // recurse deeper
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Build the example graph with 5 vertices (0=A,1=B,2=C,3=D,4=E)
    int N = 5;
    vector<vector<int>> adj(N);
    adj[0] = {1, 2};   // A → B, C
    adj[1] = {0, 3};   // B → A, D
    adj[2] = {0, 4};   // C → A, E
    adj[3] = {1, 4};   // D → B, E
    adj[4] = {2, 3};   // E → C, D

    vector<bool> visited(N, false);

    // Start DFS from vertex 0 (A)
    DFS(0, visited, adj);

    return 0;
}
